Things I have learned.

## Description
Not sure what this is meant to be yet. For now it will be random useless survival notes.

## Unordered list

* When pouring coffee (or drinks in general) don't hold your cup in the air. Lay it down on a table first before pouring.
* Wear sunglasses when outside.
* For easier teeth flossing, tie both ends together.
* Care for your toes when opening a door.
* Rubbing your eyes is bad.
* Breathing from the mouth is bad. It's better to breathe from the nose.
* Sleeping on your stomach is bad for your spine and eyes.
* Most IRL pranks are not worth doing.
* Protect ears from loud noses, prevent permanent hearing loss. It's worth it to have noise reduction plugs with you.
* Making lists is a good idea.
