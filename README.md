Not sure what this is meant to be yet. For now it will be random useless survival notes.

## Unordered list

* For easier teeth flossing, tie both ends together.
* Care for your toes when opening a door.
* Rubbing your eyes is bad.
* Breathing from the mouth is bad. It's better to breathe from the nose.
