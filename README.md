Things I have learned.

## Description
Not sure what this is meant to be yet. For now it will be random useless survival notes.

## Unordered list

* When pouring coffee (or drinks in general) don't hold your cup in the air. Lay it down on a table first before pouring.
* Wear sunglasses when outside.
* For easier teeth flossing, tie both ends together.
* Care for your toes when opening a door.
* Rubbing your eyes is bad.
* Breathing from the mouth is bad. It's better to breathe from the nose.
* Sleeping on your stomach is bad for your spine and eyes.
* Most IRL pranks are not worth doing.
* Protect ears from loud noses, prevent permanent hearing loss. It's worth it to have noise reduction plugs with you.
* Making lists is a good idea.
* There are days where you're smart and days where you're dumb. Plan during the good days.
* The first time you do a task, take your time, apply yourself and do it right. After you understand it you can optimize or automate it.
* Find your physical and psychological blindspots.
  * One of my physical blindspot was when storing a glass behind other glasses in a cupboard. I'm likely to knock some on the way out if I'm not careful.
  * One of my psychological blindspot is that I take my coffee black. This means that I can fill the cup with more coffee without caring. With that logic I might end up not leaving some for others if I'm not careful.
* When learning new information or facts, it's a good practice to also memorize the data source or who taught it to you.
* Use the right tools for the job when possible.
* When you're happy try to remember how that feels, when you're sad too, or any emotions. Helps stay grounded over time I think.
* If you put something in front of a door don't be surprised if people walk on it.
* Time doesn't fly and life isn't short.
* Everything that can be said can be said badly.
* Ants have a super power when it comes to memory. Their memory is stored physically on the ground. If the ground gets disturbed, they forget permanently.
* One of the ability I value the most in this information age is scanning. Scanning is going through large bodies of text and extracting the information you need quickly. The more you know about a subject, the faster you can scan, targeting specific keywords.
* To enjoy life more, I find that it's worth it to look at activities through the eyes of a pro. For example learning more about cinematography or filmmaking to enjoy movies and notice more of the details at play. Learn about what makes people passionate about a subject.
* If you have something that's imperfect or broken, you can tell yourself that a 3D artist would pay good money for that.
* It's easy for a human to become a zombie.
