Things I have learned.

## Description
Not sure what this is meant to be yet. For now it will be random useless survival notes.

## Unordered list

* When pouring coffee (or drinks in general) don't hold your cup in the air. Lay it down on a table first before pouring.
* Wear sunglasses when outside.
* For easier teeth flossing, tie both ends together.
* Care for your toes when opening a door.
* Rubbing your eyes is bad.
* Breathing from the mouth is bad. It's better to breathe from the nose.
* Sleeping on your stomach is bad for your spine and eyes.
* Most IRL pranks are not worth doing.
* Protect ears from loud noses, prevent permanent hearing loss. It's worth it to have noise reduction plugs with you.
* Making lists is a good idea.
* There are days where you're smart and days where you're dumb. Plan during the good days.
* The first time you do a task, take your time, apply yourself and do it right. After you understand it you can optimize or automate it.
* Find your physical and psychological blindspots.
  * One of my physical blindspot was when storing a glass behind other glasses in a cupboard. I'm likely to knock some on the way out if I'm not careful.
  * One of my psychological blindspot is that I take my coffee black. This means that I can fill the cup with more coffee without caring. With that logic I might end up not leaving some for others if I'm not careful.
* When learning new information or facts, it's a good practice to also memorize the data source or who taught it to you.
